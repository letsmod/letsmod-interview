# Running the Project

To run this project, type `npm run dev` from the project root directory.  A local webserver should start and open the project in a new browser window.  Saving any changes to the source files should cause the page to reload with the updated code.

# Development

The project's base implementation can be found in `src/index.ts`.  Changes may be made directly to that file, or added to new files and imported into that file.  The other files included in this project's repository are there to facilitate quickly getting it to run in a browser; there should be no need to change them.

You are encouraged to make commits to your working copy of the project as you add and change features of the project.  To submit an answer to the interview project, simply create a pull request from your working copy and notify the interviewer that you have done so.
